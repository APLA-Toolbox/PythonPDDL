# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Documentation lives in one place: `.docs/`.** It was spread over three
  directories — `docs/` for the contributor files and the README charts,
  `promo/` for the videos and screenshots, `.docs/` for the research notes —
  with no rule saying which took what, so every new file was a guess. The
  research notes, the release runbook and every image, video and measurement
  cache are now under `.docs/`, with binaries in `.docs/assets/`. This also
  matches `pymapf`, the sibling project.

  Paths quoted in the released sections below are the ones that were correct
  at the time. `promo/rl-data.json` is now `.docs/assets/rl-data.json`, and
  `docs/images/` is now `.docs/assets/`.

  `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` moved to `.github/` rather than
  `.docs/`: GitHub only recognises those two files in the repository root,
  `.github/` or `docs/`, so filing them under `.docs/` would have silently
  dropped the contributing link on the issue and pull-request forms.

## [2.4.0]

### Added
- **A Research view in the workbench.** `jupyddl.learn` shipped in 2.3.0 with
  its results only in `.docs/` and a video, which meant the published site said
  nothing about the biggest addition in the release. The view carries the
  measured run: imitation against `hff` and `goalcount`, the per-instance
  spread behind the mean, the logistics loss and why the feature space causes
  it, and the three claims that turned out to be wrong. Its numbers are built
  from `promo/rl-data.json` — the same cache the RL video renders from — so
  the page and the video cannot drift apart, and a test pins them together.

### Fixed
- **Reading the workbench no longer costs a 10 MB download.** `<main>` was
  hidden until Pyodide reported ready, so every page of prose, the requirement
  matrix and the new Research view sat behind a full-screen spinner waiting for
  a runtime none of them use. The shell now renders immediately from the
  committed bundle, the boot notice is a status bar rather than a splash
  screen, and only the controls that actually run a planner stay disabled until
  the interpreter arrives.

### Changed
- **Python 3.10 is the new floor**, and the matrix runs 3.10 through 3.14.
  3.9 reached end of life in October 2025; `requires-python` moved to match
  what is actually tested.
- The `pddl-examples` submodule advances to a corpus that now grows on its own:
  it imports fresh domains from planning.domains daily.
- All URLs follow the organisation's rename to `openplan-labs`.

### Removed
- Mergify. Its auto-merge rule waited on an approving review that a
  single-maintainer project does not produce, and its reviewer-assign rule
  pinged an inactive account; every recent pull request was merged by hand.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added
- **`jupyddl.learn`: heuristics trained from your own solved plans.** Every
  solved instance is a labelled trajectory — the cost of a plan's suffix from a
  state on it is that state's cost-to-go — so a corpus of plans is supervision
  that already exists. Stdlib-only like the rest of the core; `pip install
  jupyddl[learn]` adds NumPy purely for speed, and the two code paths are pinned
  together by a test.
- **A ranking objective, by default.** Greedy best-first search never reads a
  heuristic value, only the order it imposes, so the loss optimises the order:
  at each state on a plan, the successor the plan took should sort ahead of the
  siblings it passed over. A small regression term is kept to anchor a scale,
  which pure ranking leaves undefined and `wastar` needs. Checkpoints are
  selected on top-1 ranking accuracy rather than validation error.
- **A reinforcement stage that optimises search cost directly**, since "nodes
  expanded" is not a differentiable function of the weights: DAgger for the
  distribution shift, bootstrapping for the instances too hard to label, and
  the cross-entropy method over the weight vector with the planner as a black
  box. On blocksworld this took a held-out set from 366 expansions and 0.90
  coverage to 137 and 1.00 — though see `.docs/rl-for-search.md`: that mean is
  dominated by one hard instance, and the durable claim is the coverage one.
- **`jupyddl learn`**, and `learned:<model.json>` accepted anywhere a heuristic
  name is — `solve`, `benchmark`, the API. `make_heuristic` also passes through
  an already-built heuristic, so callers holding a trained model need not
  round-trip it to disk.
- `.docs/` — research notes: the prior work, the measured results including the
  domain where this loses badly and exactly why, the MDP the RL stage
  corresponds to, and a roadmap.

### Fixed
- **`always` was not enforced across the actions timed initial literals compile
  to.** The invariant went onto the domain's own actions and the goal, on the
  argument that every state is either taken from by an action or is the final
  one — but the firing and waiting actions a timed literal compiles to also
  change facts, and they were exempt. A literal clearing `(safe)` at t=3 and one
  restoring it at t=4 fire back-to-back, so the unsafe state in between was
  never checked and the plan was reported valid. Invariants now go onto every
  action.
- **The browser bundle is byte-reproducible again.** `tools/build_web.py`
  sorted the files inside each directory but let `os.walk` visit the
  subdirectories in filesystem order, so `jupyddl-sources.json` came out
  byte-different on a CI runner and the staleness check failed on a bundle that
  was not stale.
- **`format` no longer strands `pages`.** It reformats `jupyddl/` and commits to
  main; `web/dist` embeds those sources verbatim and `pages` refuses to deploy a
  bundle that has drifted, so the reformat could leave main undeployable. The
  rebuild now rides along in the same commit.
- **The sdist shipped 6.6 MB of marketing.** Hatchling's defaults packed the
  promo video, every screenshot and every documentation chart alongside a 105 KB
  wheel. Now 235 KB, and it still builds, installs and passes its own suite —
  which two parser tests previously broke, hard-failing without the
  `pddl-examples` submodule instead of skipping like the other 156.
- **Mergify's auto-merge rule matched no check.** It required
  `check-success=tests`, which is the *workflow* name — the checks are the
  matrix jobs (`test (ubuntu-latest, 3.12, dev)`), so the rule never fired.

### Changed
- CI runs the suite on Python 3.13 and 3.14 as well as 3.9–3.12, and lints
  `tools/` alongside `jupyddl` and `tests`.
- One matrix entry installs the `viz` extra. `tests/test_viz.py` and
  `tests/test_cli_viz.py` `importorskip` matplotlib, so 26 of their 30 tests —
  the entire charting surface — were silently skipped in CI.
- `build` no longer re-runs the lint the `tests` matrix already ran. It builds
  the sdist and wheel, `twine check`s them, installs the wheel into a clean
  environment and plans with it from outside the repository — packaging
  breakage an editable install cannot show.
- `actions/checkout` v4 → v7, `actions/setup-python` v5 → v7,
  `codecov/codecov-action` v4 → v7 (#146, #150, #145); the `format` job runs on
  Python 3.14 (#149); the Mergify config drops the deprecated
  `delete_head_branch` block (#143).

## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-28

Closes the PDDL gap: 20 of the 21 requirement flags are now supported, up from
15. Everything new is a source-to-source compilation applied before grounding,
so the search engine is untouched.

### Added
- **`jupyddl.compile`**: PDDL 3 constructs are rewritten into the classical core
  before grounding. Every fact and action it invents is prefixed `__` and hidden
  from printed plans.
- **`:constraints`** — `always`, `at-end`, `sometime`, `sometime-before`,
  `sometime-after` and `at-most-once`. `always` becomes a precondition on every
  action plus a goal conjunct (the three checks between them cover every state
  on a trajectory). `sometime`/`sometime-before` use optional monitor actions;
  `sometime-after`/`at-most-once` use *forced* monitors on conditional effects,
  because a constraint the planner could satisfy by not looking would not be a
  constraint. The metric-time forms (`within`, `hold-during`, ...) are refused
  by name.
- **`:preferences`** — goal preferences become a priced choice: a closing action
  freezes the state, then each preference is resolved for free if it holds or at
  its `(is-violated p)` weight if not, so plain cost-optimal search minimises the
  metric. Freezing first is what stops a preference being satisfied halfway
  through and then broken. Soft trajectory constraints are refused.
- **`:timed-initial-literals`** — elapsed time becomes a numeric fluent advanced
  by action durations, with a firing action per literal, a wait action that
  advances the clock, guards that stop anything else happening while a due
  literal has not fired, and an ordering constraint so literals fire in time
  order.
- **`:object-fluents`** — compiled to a predicate plus a uniqueness rule;
  `assign` clears the old value first so the function stays single-valued.
  Nested-term use is refused in favour of the equality form.
- **`:duration-inequalities`** — bounds are collected and the shortest feasible
  duration chosen, which is makespan-optimal with no concurrency. Strict
  `<`/`>` are refused: they have no shortest feasible value.
- New demos: `errands` (preferences + constraints) and `timed-market` (timed
  literals).

### Changed
- The promo video is re-cut for what the library became: three new scenes cover
  the 21-flag support matrix, the soft-goal trade-off in `errands` and the
  timed-literal schedule in `timed-market`, and the browser scene now shows the
  four-view workbench. Still 100% measured at render time.
- `Task.makespan` replays the clock when a task has one. Waiting for a timed
  literal advances time without any action taking that long, so summing
  durations under-reported the end time.
- `:fluents` now genuinely covers both halves; `:preferences`, `:constraints`,
  `:timed-initial-literals`, `:object-fluents` and `:duration-inequalities`
  moved off the rejected list.

### Still not supported
- `:continuous-effects`, and **true temporal concurrency**. Durative actions
  compile to a sequential schedule and never overlap, so a plan needing two
  actions to run at once will not be found. That needs a mutex-aware temporal
  scheduler rather than another compilation.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-28

Grows the PDDL fragment from STRIPS to most of PDDL 3.1, and turns the browser
playground into a research workbench.

### Added
- **`jupyddl.requirements`**: one registry saying what happens to every PDDL
  requirement flag — native, compiled, partial or rejected — with the reason.
  The parser, `jupyddl requirements`, the README table and the web UI all read
  it, so they cannot drift apart.
- **Full ADL conditions**: `or`, `imply`, `exists` and nested `not` in
  preconditions, goals and `when` conditions. The parser produces negation
  normal form; the grounder expands quantifiers over the object pool and
  distributes to DNF, emitting one operator per disjunct. A disjunctive goal is
  compiled to an artificial goal fact reached by a zero-cost operator per
  disjunct, hidden from the printed plan via `Task.visible_plan`.
- **Derived predicates** (`:derived`): rules are grounded into `Axiom`s and
  closed to a least fixpoint after every state change, and enter the
  delete-relaxation as zero-cost rules so the heuristics stay admissible.
- **Numeric fluents**: comparisons in preconditions and goals, and
  `assign`/`increase`/`decrease`/`scale-up`/`scale-down` effects over arithmetic
  expressions. Numeric tasks carry a `State` with a value vector; classical
  tasks keep the bare frozenset and pay nothing.
- **Durative actions**: parsed with `at start`/`over all`/`at end` conditions and
  effects, compiled to sequential actions carrying their duration, with
  `Task.makespan`. Concurrency is explicitly *not* modelled — see the support
  table.
- **Five more planners**: hill climbing (`hc`), beam search (`beam`), Iterated
  Width (`iw`), branch and bound (`bnb`) and anytime weighted A* (`awastar`).
- **Search budgets**: `max_expansions` and `time_limit` on every planner, the
  API and the benchmark harness. A run that stops on its budget sets
  `stats.truncated`, so an empty result never masquerades as a proof of
  unsolvability.
- **`jupyddl.generator`**: seven reproducible instance generators — same
  *(kind, size, seed)*, same bytes — plus `jupyddl generate`.
- **New demo instances**: `rovers` (ADL), `network` (recursive axioms),
  `numeric-transport`, `workshop` (temporal) and `blocksworld12`.
- **New CLI commands**: `jupyddl requirements` and `jupyddl generate`;
  `--max-expansions` / `--time-limit` on `solve` and `benchmark`.
- **The web workbench**: four views — Solve, Experiment (an instance ×
  configuration sweep with a sortable table and CSV/JSON export), PDDL support,
  and Generate.

### Changed
- Planners take their initial state from `Task.initial_state()` and step through
  `Task.apply()`, so axioms close and numeric values flow without every planner
  knowing about either.
- `validate_plan` replays through the task instead of the raw operators; it
  previously started from `task.init` and so saw neither axioms nor numbers.
- `Operator.base_name` strips compilation tags, so a plan prints the action the
  domain author wrote rather than `move(a,b)#2`.
- `SearchResult.plan_names(canonical=True)` returns those canonical names.
- Budget clock checks happen every expansion, not every 256: under LM-cut a
  single expansion can cost tens of milliseconds, and the coarse interval
  overshot a short time limit by more than an order of magnitude.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-27

Makes the search **observable**: you can now record it, plot it, watch it live,
animate it, and run the whole thing in a browser.

### Added
- **Search instrumentation** (`jupyddl.trace`): a `SearchObserver` protocol with
  no-op defaults, a `TraceRecorder` that accumulates a serialisable
  `SearchTrace` (JSON round-trip, bounded memory via adaptive thinning), a
  `MultiObserver` for fan-out, and `trace_search()` in the high-level API. Every
  planner emits start/expand/generate/bound/goal/finish events; tracing is
  opt-in and provably transparent (tests assert an observed search returns the
  same plan and statistics as an unobserved one).
- **Zero-dependency live terminal dashboard** (`jupyddl.live`): Unicode
  sparklines, a frontier gauge, live counters and a node rate, repainted with
  ANSI escapes; degrades to periodic one-line output on a non-tty.
- **Visualisation module** (`jupyddl.viz`, the `viz` extra): a validated
  light/dark chart theme plus `plot_search_progress`, `plot_search_tree`
  (radial wavefront), `plot_planner_comparison`, `plot_benchmark_dashboard` and
  `plot_plan_timeline`; `LiveSearchPlot` for notebooks and `animate_search` for
  MP4/GIF replays.
- **Browser playground** (`web/`): runs the unmodified library under Pyodide in
  a web worker, with an editable PDDL editor, live-updating charts, an animated
  search wavefront and a four-planner race. Bundled by `tools/build_web.py` and
  deployed to GitHub Pages.
- **Six demo instances** (`demos/`): gripper, blocksworld8, hanoi, logistics,
  sokoban and elevator, covering type hierarchies, action costs, conditional
  effects, static-predicate pruning and an untyped domain.
- **New CLI commands and flags**: `jupyddl animate`, `jupyddl demo`, and
  `--live`, `--trace`, `--plot`, `--tree`, `--plan-plot`, `--dark` on `solve`;
  `--dashboard` on `benchmark`.
- `tools/make_promo.py`, which renders the project's promo video from numbers it
  measures at render time.

### Changed
- `Planner.search()` and `best_first()` take an optional `observer`; `solve()`
  and `solve_task()` pass one through. Existing calls are unaffected.
- Chart helpers release their figure after writing a file, so rendering a large
  gallery no longer accumulates figures in memory.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-01

Complete rewrite: **the Julia dependency is removed** and the project is now a
pure-Python planning framework.

### Added
- Hand-written PDDL tokenizer, AST and recursive-descent parser
  (`jupyddl.parser`).
- Grounder (`jupyddl.grounding`) with type hierarchies, static-predicate
  pruning, positive-normal-form compilation of negative preconditions/goals,
  object harvesting for undeclared constants, and `forall`/`when` conditional
  effect expansion.
- Grounded task representation with conditional effects (`jupyddl.task`).
- Planners (`jupyddl.search`): BFS, DFS, Iterative Deepening, Dijkstra
  (uniform cost), Greedy Best-First, A*, Weighted A*, IDA*, and Enforced Hill
  Climbing, plus a shared best-first engine and a planner registry.
- Heuristics (`jupyddl.heuristics`): blind, goal-count, `h_max`, `h_add`, FF,
  critical-path `h^m` (`h1`/`h2`), and LM-cut, plus a heuristic registry.
- Benchmarking harness (`jupyddl.benchmark`) with CSV export and comparison
  plots, and a CLI (`jupyddl solve` / `jupyddl benchmark`).
- High-level API: `solve`, `build_task`, `solve_task`, `validate_plan`.
- Comprehensive pytest suite covering parsing, grounding, search optimality,
  heuristic admissibility, the API, the benchmark harness and the CLI.

### Changed
- Packaging migrated from `setup.py`/`requirements.txt` to `pyproject.toml`
  (hatchling); the core has **zero runtime dependencies** (matplotlib is an
  optional `viz` extra).
- CI reworked to run on modern Python without Julia.

### Removed
- The Julia / `PDDL.jl` / PyCall / pyjulia integration and the old
  `AutomatedPlanner` / `DataAnalyst` API.
