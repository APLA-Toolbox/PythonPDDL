"""Bundle jupyddl and the demo instances for the browser playground.

The playground runs the *real* library under Pyodide rather than a JavaScript
re-implementation. Because the core is stdlib-only, there is nothing to compile
and no wheel to resolve: we simply hand Pyodide the package sources and let it
import them. This script writes:

* ``web/dist/jupyddl-sources.json`` — ``{module path: source}`` for the pure
  Python part of the package (:mod:`jupyddl.viz` is skipped; it needs matplotlib,
  which the playground does not load);
* ``web/dist/demos.json`` — the bundled demo domains and problems;
* ``web/dist/build.json`` — version and build metadata shown in the footer.

Run it from the repository root::

    python tools/build_web.py
