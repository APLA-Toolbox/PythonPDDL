\section{Introduction}
In this section we briefly intoduce what we are trying to achieve, what PDDL is, how the software is organized, and other stuff like that.
\section{Parsing PDDL Files}\label{sec:parsing-pddl}
In this section we talk about how the parser has been implemented.

\section{Implementation of Graph search algorithms}

\subsection{Breadth-First Search}

\subsection{Depth-First Search}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

\section{Search for Admissible Heuristics}\label{sec:heuristic}
This will have two subsections, one for each heuristic. Briefly explain what an admissible heuristic is supposed to be.

\section{A* Implementation}\label{sec:a-star}
In this section we talk about how one can implement A* on PDDL using this software

\section{Simulation Results}\label{sec:sim-results}
Here we speak about the efficiency of the tool.
